#
# This is the main IBM HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/manual70/> for detailed 
# information about the Apache directives.
#
# The instructions provided in this configuration file are only hints or
# reminders.  Consult the online docs for definitive information.
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the web server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same web server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/opt/IBM/HTTPServer" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/logs/foo.log".
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of IBM HTTP
# Server, such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where 
# it can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot "/opt/IBM/HTTPServer"

#
# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
#
#LockFile logs/accept.lock

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
PidFile logs/httpd.pid

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 10

##
## Server-Pool Size Regulation (MPM specific)
## 

# worker MPM
#
# For tuning recommendations, refer to <NEWINFOCENTERURL>.
#
# ThreadLimit: maximum setting of ThreadsPerChild
# ServerLimit: maximum setting of StartServers
# StartServers: initial number of server processes to start
# MaxClients: maximum number of simultaneous client connections
# MinSpareThreads: minimum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# MaxSpareThreads: maximum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# ThreadsPerChild: constant number of worker threads in each server process

# Listen: Allows you to bind the web server to specific IP addresses 
# and/or ports, in addition to the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.

# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Statically compiled modules (those listed by `httpd -l') do not need
# to be loaded here.
#
# Example:
# LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so
LoadModule authz_host_module modules/mod_authz_host.so

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.  
#
User nobody
Group nobody

#
# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
#
ServerAdmin you@your.address

#
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, server-generated
# redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make 
# redirections work in a sensible way.
#
ServerName prplhttpsrvr1.csplab.local:80

#
# UseCanonicalName: Determines how the web server constructs self-
# referencing URLs and the SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT variables.
# When set "Off", the web server will use the Hostname and Port supplied
# by the client.  When set "On", it will use the value of the ServerName
# directive.
#
UseCanonicalName Off

#
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
DocumentRoot "/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/htdocs"

#
# Each directory to which the web server has access can be configured
# with respect to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled 
# in that directory (and its subdirectories). 
#
# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of 
# features.  
#
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks

#
# Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow
# particular features to be enabled - so if something's not working as

# below.
#

#
# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#

#
# Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",

#
# DirectoryIndex: sets the file that the web server will serve if a

#
# The index.html.var file (a type-map) is used to deliver content-
# negotiated documents.  The MultiViews Option can be used for the 
# same purpose, but it is much slower.

#
# DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a document
# if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.
# If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, "text/plain" is
# a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications
# or images, you may want to use "application/octet-stream" instead to
# keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are
# text.
#

#
# The mod_mime_magic module allows the server to use various hints from the

#
# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
#
HostnameLookups Off

#
# EnableMMAP: Control whether memory-mapping is used to deliver
# files (assuming that the underlying OS supports it).
# The default is on; turn this off if you serve from NFS-mounted

#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
#
ErrorLog logs/error_log

#
# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error log.
# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
# alert, emerg.

#
# The following directives define some format nicknames for use with
# a CustomLog directive (see below).
#
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
LogFormat "%{Referer}i -> %U" referer
LogFormat "%{User-agent}i" agent

#
# The location and format of the access logfile (Common Logfile Format).
# If you do not define any access logfiles within a <VirtualHost>
# container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you *do*
# define per-<VirtualHost> access logfiles, transactions will be
# logged therein and *not* in this file.

#
# If you would like to have agent and referer logfiles, uncomment the
# following directives.
#
#CustomLog logs/referer_log referer

#
# If you prefer a single logfile with access, agent, and referer information
# (Combined Logfile Format) you can use the following directive.
#
#CustomLog logs/access_log combined

#
# AddServerHeader
# This directive provides a means to enable or disable ServerHeader values.
# The default value is "On". This provides a server header according to the
# values specified in the ServerTokens and ServerSignature directives.
# Setting this directive to "Off" results in no server header information
# being returned to clients.
# Set to one of: On | Off
#
#AddServerHeader Off

#
# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The built-in default is 'Full' which sends information about 
# the OS-type and compiled in modules.  The recommended value is 'Prod' 
# which sends the least information.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minor | Minimal | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
#

# Customizable error responses come in three flavors:

#
# Putting this all together, we can internationalize error responses.
#
# We use Alias to redirect any /error/HTTP_<error>.html.var response to
# our collection of by-error message multi-language collections.  We use 
# includes to substitute the appropriate text.
#
# You can modify the messages' appearance without changing any of the
# default HTTP_<error>.html.var files by adding the line:
#
#   Alias /error/include/ "/your/include/path/"
#
# which allows you to create your own set of files by starting with the
# /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/error/include/ files and copying them to /your/include/path/, 
# even on a per-VirtualHost basis.  The default include files will display
# your IBM HTTP Server version number and your ServerAdmin email address
# regardless of the setting of ServerSignature.

### Section 3: Virtual Hosts
#
# VirtualHost: If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/manual70/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
#NameVirtualHost *

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for requests without a known
# server name.
#
#<VirtualHost *>
#    ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
#    DocumentRoot /www/docs/dummy-host.example.com
#    ServerName dummy-host.example.com
#    ErrorLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-error_log
#    CustomLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-access_log common
#</VirtualHost>

# Example SSL configuration which supports SSLv3 and TLSv1
# To enable this support:
#   1) Create a key database with ikeyman
#   2) Update the KeyFile directive below to point to that key database
#   3) Uncomment the directives up through the end of the example
#
#LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so
#Listen 443
#<VirtualHost *:443>
#SSLEnable
#SSLProtocolDisable SSLv2
#</VirtualHost>
#KeyFile /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/ihsserverkey.kdb
#SSLDisable
# End of example SSL configuration

# Enable IBM HTTP Server diagnostic features.
#
# CoreDumpDirectory directory: Sets the location where the server will
# attempt to put a core dump.  The child processes running as 'User'
# (see User config directive above) must have permission to write to 
# this directive.  The filesystem will have to be large enough to hold 
# potentially large core files.
#
# The /tmp directory is often sufficient.
#
#CoreDumpDirectory /tmp

# mod_mpmstats logs statistics about server activity to the main
# error log.  No records are written while the server is idle.
LoadModule mpmstats_module modules/debug/mod_mpmstats.so
<IfModule mod_mpmstats.c>
# Write a record every 10 minutes (if server isn't idle).
# Recommendation: Lower this interval to 60 seconds, which will
# result in the error log growing faster but with more accurate
# information about server load.
ReportInterval 600
# Include details of active module in the statistics.

</IfModule>

# EnableExceptionHook allows modules such as mod_backtrace and
# mod_whatkilledus to run after a crash and gather additional
# diagnostic information.
# EnableExceptionHook must be "on" in order to use mod_backtrace or
# mod_whatkilledus.
EnableExceptionHook On

# mod_backtrace will record a backtrace of the crashing thread to the
# error log at the time of a crash.  This is important information for
# diagnosing the cause of the crash.
LoadModule backtrace_module modules/debug/mod_backtrace.so

# mod_whatkilledus will record information about the current request
# and connection to the error log at the time of a crash.  This is
# important information for diagnosing the cause of the crash.
LoadModule whatkilledus_module modules/debug/mod_whatkilledus.so

# mod_net_trace will record actual data sent/received from the client
# and on proxy connections, even for SSL connections.  Unlike an IP
# trace, interaction with the platform network APIs can be seen.
# The following example configuration can be activated by uncommenting
# the LoadModule directive.
#LoadModule net_trace_module modules/debug/mod_net_trace.so
<IfModule mod_net_trace.c>
NetTraceFile /tmp/nettrace
